    <h1>About</h1>

    <p class="intro">
      I am an undergraduate researcher interested in how theoretical and quantitative ecology can be
      meaningfully translated into practical, hands-on management decisions. My work is driven by a
      central question:
      <strong>
        how can we bridge ecological theory and modeling with the realities of conservation and land
        management in complex, dynamic systems?
      </strong>
    </p>

      <h2>What I’m working toward</h2>
      <p>
        I am particularly drawn to problems where modeling structure matters—where the way we
        formalize ecological processes has real consequences for interpretation, decision-making, and
        outcomes on the ground. I am interested in movement ecology, spatial and mechanistic modeling,
        and the broader statistical and computational frameworks that allow us to better represent
        wildlife populations as dynamic systems rather than static patterns.
      </p>
      <p>
        Across projects, I am motivated by questions such as how close we can reasonably get to
        modeling the complexity of ecological systems, what simplifying assumptions are defensible,
        and how models can remain useful for practitioners making real management decisions.
      </p>

      <h2 style="margin-top: 1.4rem;">Where I’m at</h2>
      <p>
        At my current stage, I view my work as preparation for graduate study and a long-term career
        in academia. I am especially interested in
        contributing to methodological and conceptual work that improves how ecological models are
        built, interpreted, and applied—particularly in contexts where management objectives,
        uncertainty, and tradeoffs are unavoidable.
      </p>

      <h2 style="margin-top: 1.4rem;">Why I care</h2>
      <p>
        My interest in conservation is also shaped by faith and a strong sense of stewardship. I see
        ecological management not only as a technical challenge, but as a moral one—rooted in care,
        responsibility, and respect for both landscapes and the people who depend on them.
      </p>
      <p>
        While models and methods are essential tools, I believe effective management ultimately
        requires an ethic grounded in humility and love, recognizing the limits of our knowledge while
        striving to act thoughtfully and responsibly.
      </p>

      <h2 style="margin-top: 1.4rem;">Outside of research</h2>
      <p>
        I am married to my wife, Lily, who is an essential part of my life and a constant source of
        support, perspective, and and strength. Together, we hold a shared
        commitment to learning and growth.
      </p>

      <h2 style="margin-top: 1.4rem;">What I’m hoping to build</h2>
      <p style="margin-bottom: 0;">
        I am eager to continue developing as a researcher, to learn from advisors and collaborators
        who think deeply about both theory and application, and to contribute work that helps connect
        rigorous ecological modeling with meaningful conservation practice.
